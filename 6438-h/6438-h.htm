&nbsp; A farmer built around his crop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wall, and crowned his labors<br>
&nbsp; By placing glass upon the top<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lacerate his neighbors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Provided they at any time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should feel disposed the wall to climb.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; He also drove some iron pegs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Securely in the coping,<br>
&nbsp; To tear the bare, defenceless legs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of brats who, upward groping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Might steal, despite the risk of fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The grapes that grew upon the wall.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; One day a fox, on thieving bent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A crafty and an old one,<br>
&nbsp; Most shrewdly tracked the pungent scent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That eloquently told one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That grapes were ripe and grapes were good<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; And likewise in the neighborhood.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; He threw some stones of divers shapes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The luscious fruit to jar off:<br>
&nbsp; It made him ill to see the grapes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So near and yet so far off.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; His throws were strong, his aim was
fine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; But "Never touched me!" said the vine.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; The farmer shouted, "Drat the boys!"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, mounting on a ladder,<br>
&nbsp; He sought the cause of all the noise;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No farmer could be madder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Which was not hard to understand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Because the glass had cut his hand.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; His passion he could not restrain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But shouted out, "You're thievish!"<br>
&nbsp; The fox replied, with fine disdain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come, country, don't be peevish."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (Now "country" is an epithet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One can't forgive, nor yet forget.)<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; The farmer rudely answered back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With compliments unvarnished,<br>
&nbsp; And downward hurled the <span style="font-style: italic;">bric-&agrave;-brac</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With which the wall was garnished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In view of which demeanor strange,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fox retreated out of range.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "I will not try the grapes to-day,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said. "My appetite is<br>
&nbsp; Fastidious, and, anyway,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear appendicitis."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (The fox was one of the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">&eacute;lite</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Who call it <span style="font-style: italic;">site</span>
instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">seet</span>.)<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; The moral is that if your host<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throws glass around his entry<br>
&nbsp; You know it isn't done by most<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who claim to be the gentry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; While if he hits you in the head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You may be sure he's underbred.<br>

&nbsp; Once a turtle, finding plenty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In seclusion to bewitch,<br>
&nbsp; Lived a <span style="font-style: italic;">dolce far niente</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kind of life within a ditch;<br>
&nbsp; Rivers had no charm for him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he told his wife and daughter,<br>
&nbsp; "Though my friends are in the swim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mud is thicker far than water."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; One fine day, as was his habit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was dozing in the sun,<br>
&nbsp; When a young and flippant rabbit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happened by the ditch to run:<br>
&nbsp; "Come and race me," he exclaimed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fat inhabitant of puddles.<br>
&nbsp; Sluggard! You should be ashamed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a life the brain befuddles."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; This, of course, was banter merely,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it stirred the torpid blood<br>
&nbsp; Of the turtle, and severely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth he issued from the mud.<br>
&nbsp; "Done!" he cried. The race began,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the hare resumed his banter,<br>
&nbsp; Seeing how his rival ran<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a most unlovely canter.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Shouting, "Terrapin, you're bested!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd be wiser, dear old chap,<br>
&nbsp; If you sat you down and rested<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you reach the second lap."<br>
&nbsp; Quoth the turtle, "I refuse.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for you, with all your talking,<br>
&nbsp; Sit on any lap you choose.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> shall
simply go on walking."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Now this sporting proposition<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was, upon its face, absurd;<br>
&nbsp; Yet the hare, with expedition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Took the tortoise at his word,<br>
&nbsp; Ran until the final lap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, supposing he'd outclassed him,<br>
&nbsp; Laid him down and took a nap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the patient turtle passed him!<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Plodding on, he shortly made the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line that marked the victor's goal;<br>
&nbsp; Paused, and found he'd won, and laid the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flattering unction to his soul.<br>
&nbsp; Then in fashion grandiose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like an after-dinner speaker,<br>
&nbsp; Touched his flipper to his nose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And remarked, "Ahem! Eureka!"<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And THE MORAL (lest you miss one)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is: There's often time to spare,<br>
&nbsp; And that races are (like this one)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Won not always by a hair.<br>

&nbsp; Once a flock of stately peacocks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promenaded on a green,<br>
&nbsp; There were twenty-two or three cocks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each as proud as seventeen,<br>
&nbsp; And a glance, however hasty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Showed their plumage to be tasty;<br>
&nbsp; Wheresoever one was placed, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was a credit to the scene.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Now their owner had a daughter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, when people came to call,<br>
&nbsp; Used to say, "You'd reelly oughter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See them peacocks on the mall."<br>
&nbsp; Now this wasn't to her credit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her callers came to dread it,<br>
&nbsp; For the way the lady said it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wasn't&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;">recherch&eacute;</span> at all.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; But a jay that overheard it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his perch upon a fir<br>
&nbsp; Didn't take in how absurd it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was to every one but her;<br>
&nbsp; When they answered, "You don't tell us!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to see the birds seemed zealous<br>
&nbsp; He became extremely jealous,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wishing, too, to make a stir.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; As the peacocks fed together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would join them at their lunch,<br>
&nbsp; Culling here and there a feather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he'd gathered quite a bunch;<br>
&nbsp; Then this bird, of ways perfidious,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuck them on him most fastidious<br>
&nbsp; Till he looked uncommon hideous,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a Judy or a Punch.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; But the peacocks, when they saw him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One and all began to haul,<br>
&nbsp; And to harry and to claw him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the creature couldn't crawl;<br>
&nbsp; While their owner's vulgar daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When her startled callers sought her,<br>
&nbsp; And to see the struggle brought her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only said, "They're on the maul."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; It was really quite revolting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the tumult died away,<br>
&nbsp; One would think he had been moulting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So dishevelled was the jay;<br>
&nbsp; He was more than merely slighted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was more than disunited,<br>
&nbsp; He'd been simply dynamited<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fervor of the fray.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And THE MORAL of the verses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is: That short men can't be tall.<br>
&nbsp; Nothing sillier or worse is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than a jay upon a mall.<br>
&nbsp; And the jay opiniative<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, because he's imitative,<br>
&nbsp; Thinks he's highly decorative<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the biggest jay of all.<br>

&nbsp; Once, on a time and in a place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conducive to malaria,<br>
&nbsp; There lived a member of the race<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of <span style="font-style: italic;">Rana Temporaria</span>;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, more concisely still, a frog<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inhabited a certain bog.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; A bull of Brobdingnagian size,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too proud for condescension,<br>
&nbsp; One morning chanced to cast his eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the frog I mention;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, being to the manner born,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surveyed him with a lofty scorn.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Perceiving this, the bactrian's frame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With anger was inflated,<br>
&nbsp; Till, growing larger, he became<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Egregiously elated;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For inspiration's sudden spell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had pointed out a way to swell.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "Ha! ha!" he proudly cried, "a fig<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this, your mammoth torso!<br>
&nbsp; Just watch me while I grow as big<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you--or even more so!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To which magniloquential gush<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His bullship simply answered "Tush!"<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Alas! the frog's success was slight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which really was a wonder,<br>
&nbsp; In view of how with main and might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He strove to grow rotunder!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, standing patiently the while,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bull displayed a quiet smile.<br>
      <br>
[Illustration: "HE STROVE TO GROW ROTUNDER"]<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; But ah, the frog tried once too oft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, doing so, he busted;<br>
&nbsp; Whereat the bull discreetly coughed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And moved away, disgusted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well he might, considering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wretched taste that marked the thing.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE MORAL: Everybody knows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How ill a wind it is that blows.<br>

&nbsp; O'er a small suburban borough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once an eagle used to fly,<br>
&nbsp; Making observations thorough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From his station in the sky,<br>
&nbsp; And presenting the appearance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of an animated V,<br>
&nbsp; Like the gulls that lend coherence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto paintings of the sea.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Looking downward at a church in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This attractive little shire,<br>
&nbsp; He beheld a smallish urchin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shooting arrows at the spire;<br>
&nbsp; In a spirit of derision,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look alive!" the eagle said;<br>
&nbsp; And, with infinite precision,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dropped a feather on his head.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Then the boy, annoyed distinctly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the freedom of the bird,<br>
&nbsp; Voiced his anger quite succinctly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a single scathing word;<br>
&nbsp; And he sat him on a barrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he fashioned of this same<br>
&nbsp; Eagle's feather such an arrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was worthy of the name.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Then he tried his bow, and, stringing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It with caution and with care,<br>
&nbsp; Sent that arrow singing, winging<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards the eagle in the air.<br>
&nbsp; Straight it went, without an error,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the target, bathed in blood,<br>
&nbsp; Lurched, and lunged, and fell to <span
 style="font-style: italic;">terra</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firma</span>,
landing with a thud.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "Bird of freedom," quoth the urchin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an unrelenting frown,<br>
&nbsp; "You shall decorate a perch in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The menagerie in town;<br>
&nbsp; But of feathers quite a cluster<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall first remove for Ma:<br>
&nbsp; Thanks to you, she'll have a duster<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For her precious <span style="font-style: italic;">objets
d'art</span>."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And THE MORAL is that pride is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The precursor of a fall.<br>
&nbsp; Those beneath you to deride is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not expedient at all.<br>
&nbsp; Howsoever meek and humble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your inferiors may be,<br>
&nbsp; They perchance may make you tumble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So respect them.&nbsp; Q. E. D.<br>

&nbsp; Reposing 'neath some spreading trees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A populistic bumpkin<br>
&nbsp; Amused himself by offering these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reflections on a pumpkin:<br>
&nbsp; "I would not, if the choice were mine,<br>
&nbsp; Grow things like that upon a vine,<br>
&nbsp; For how imposing it would be<br>
&nbsp; If pumpkins grew upon a tree."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Like other populists, you'll note,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of views enthusiastic,<br>
&nbsp; He'd learned by heart, and said by rote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A creed iconoclastic;<br>
&nbsp; And in his dim, uncertain sight<br>
&nbsp; Whatever wasn't must be right,<br>
&nbsp; From which it follows he had strong<br>
&nbsp; Convictions that what was, was wrong.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; As thus he sat beneath an oak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An acorn fell abruptly<br>
&nbsp; And smote his nose: whereat he spoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of acorns most corruptly.<br>
&nbsp; "Great Scott!" he cried. "The Dickens!" too,<br>
&nbsp; And other authors whom he knew,<br>
&nbsp; And having duly mentioned those,<br>
&nbsp; He expeditiously arose.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Then, though with pain he nearly swooned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bathed his organ nasal<br>
&nbsp; With arnica, and soothed the wound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With extract of witch hazel;<br>
&nbsp; And surely we may well excuse<br>
&nbsp; The victim if he changed his views:<br>
&nbsp; "If pumpkins fell from trees like that,"<br>
&nbsp; He murmured, "Where would I be at?"<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Of course it's wholly clear to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That when these words he uttered<br>
&nbsp; He proved conclusively he knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which side his bread was buttered;<br>
&nbsp; And, if this point you have not missed,<br>
&nbsp; You'll learn to love this populist,<br>
&nbsp; The only one of all his kind<br>
&nbsp; With sense enough to change his mind.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; THE MORAL: In the early spring<br>
&nbsp; A pumpkin-tree would be a thing<br>
&nbsp; Most gratifying to us all,<br>
&nbsp; But how about the early fall?<br>

&nbsp; A woodcutter bought him a gander,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or at least that was what he supposed,<br>
&nbsp; As a matter of fact, 'twas a slander<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a later occurrence disclosed;<br>
&nbsp; For they locked the bird up in the garret<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fatten, the while it grew old,<br>
&nbsp; And it laid there a twenty-two carat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine egg of the purest of gold!<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; There was much unaffected rejoicing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the home of the woodcutter then,<br>
&nbsp; And his wife, her exuberance voicing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proclaimed him most lucky of men.<br>
&nbsp; "'Tis an omen of fortune, this gold egg,"<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a highly superior goose."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Twas this creature's habitual custom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This laying of superfine eggs,<br>
&nbsp; And they made it their practice to dust 'em<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He slaughtered the innocent goose.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In stating, "We mourn for our loss."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And THE MORAL: It isn't much use,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the woodcutter found to be true,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just because she is laying for you.<br>

&nbsp; Upon the shore, a mile or more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From traffic and confusion,<br>
&nbsp; An oyster dwelt, because he felt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A longing for seclusion;<br>
&nbsp; Said he: "I love the stillness of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This spot. It's like a cloister."<br>
&nbsp; (These words I quote because, you note,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To-be-desired quiet.<br>
&nbsp; To say the least, this tactless beast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was apt to rudely roister:<br>
&nbsp; She tapped his shell, and called him--well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A name that hurt the oyster.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "I see," she cried, "you're open wide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, searching for a reason,<br>
&nbsp; September's here, and so it's clear<br>

&nbsp; Advanced a pace with easy grace,<br>

the silent oyster.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; The latter's pride was sorely tried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought of what he <span
 style="font-style: italic;">could</span> say,<br>
&nbsp; Reflected what the common lot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of vulgar molluscs <span style="font-style: italic;">would</span>
say;<br>
&nbsp; Then caught his breath, grew pale as death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, as his brow turned moister,<br>
&nbsp; Began to close, and nipped her nose!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Superb, dramatic oyster!<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; We note with joy that oi polloi,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom maidens bite the thumb at,<br>
&nbsp; Are apt to try some weak reply<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To things they should be dumb at.<br>
&nbsp; THE MORAL, then, for crafty men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is: When a maid has voiced her<br>
&nbsp; Contemptuous heart, don't think you're smart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But shut up--like the oyster.<br>

&nbsp; He dined next night with his poor relation,<br>

&nbsp; He waited an hour in the lonely station,<br>

"Try entertaining<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, knocking at her wicket,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A common garden cricket<br>
&nbsp; So ragged, poor, and needy that,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without elucidation,<br>
&nbsp; One saw the symptoms of a bat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of several months' duration.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; He paused beside her door-step, and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With one pathetic gesture,<br>
&nbsp; He called attention with his hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To both his shoes and vesture.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat down upon the lady's lap.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Then, as her head with terror swam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This method seems to suit you,"<br>
&nbsp; Observed the ass, "so here I am."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said she, "Get up, you brute you!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And promptly screamed aloud for aid:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No ass was ever more dismayed.<br>
      <br>
[Illustration: "SAID SHE, 'GET UP, YOU BRUTE YOU!'"]<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; They took the ass into the yard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there, with whip and truncheon,<br>
&nbsp; They beat him, and they beat him hard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From breakfast-time till luncheon.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He only gave a tearful gulp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though almost pounded to a pulp.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; THE MORAL is (or seems, at least,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be): In etiquette you<br>
&nbsp; Will find that while enough's a feast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A surplus will upset you.<br>

&nbsp; A bulrush stood on a river's rim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And an oak that grew near by<br>
&nbsp; Looked down with cold <span style="font-style: italic;">hauteur</span>
on him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And addressed him this way: "Hi!"<br>
&nbsp; The rush was a proud patrician, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; He retorted, "Don't you know,<br>
&nbsp; What the veriest boor should understand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That 'Hi' is low?"<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; This cutting rebuke the oak ignored.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He returned, "My slender friend,<br>
&nbsp; I will frankly state that I'm somewhat bored<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the way you bow and bend."<br>
&nbsp; "But you quite forget," the rush replied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's an art these bows to do,<br>
&nbsp; An art I wouldn't attempt if I'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Such boughs as you."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "Of course," said the oak, "in my sapling days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My habit it was to bow,<br>
&nbsp; But the wildest storm that the winds could raise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would never disturb me now.<br>
&nbsp; I challenge the breeze to make me bend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the blast to make me sway."<br>
&nbsp; The shrewd little bulrush answered, "Friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Don't get so gay."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And the words had barely left his mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he saw the oak turn pale,<br>
&nbsp; For, racing along south-east-by-south,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Came ripping a raging gale.<br>
&nbsp; And the rush bent low as the storm went past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But stiffly stood the oak,<br>
&nbsp; Though not for long, for he found the blast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No idle joke.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp; Imagine the lightning's gleaming bars,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine the thunder's roar,<br>
&nbsp; For that is exactly what eight stars<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are set in a row here for!<br>
&nbsp; The oak lay prone when the storm was done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the rush, still quite erect,<br>
&nbsp; Remarked aside, "What under the sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Could one expect?"<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And THE MORAL, I'd have you understand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would have made La Fontaine blush,<br>
&nbsp; For it's this: Some storms come early, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Avoid the rush!<br>

&nbsp; A gaunt and relentless wolf, possessed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a quite insatiable thirst,<br>
&nbsp; Once paused at a stream to drink and rest,<br>
&nbsp; And found that, bound on a similar quest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lamb had arrived there first.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; The lamb was a lamb of a garrulous mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And frivolity most extreme:<br>
&nbsp; In the fashion common to all his kind,<br>
&nbsp; He cantered in front and galloped behind.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And troubled the limpid stream.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "My friend," said the wolf, with a winsome air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your capers I can't admire."<br>
&nbsp; "Go to!" quoth the lamb. (Though he said not where,<br>
&nbsp; He showed what he meant by his brazen stare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the way that he gambolled higher.)<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "My capers," he cried, "are the kind that are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invariably served with lamb.<br>
&nbsp; Remember, this is a public bar,<br>
&nbsp; And I'll do as I please. If your drink I mar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't give a tinker's ----."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; He paused and glanced at the rivulet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that pause than speech was worse,<br>
&nbsp; For his roving eye a saw-mill met,<br>
&nbsp; And, near it, the word which should be set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the previous verse.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Said the wolf: "You are tough and may bring remorse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But of such is the world well rid.<br>
&nbsp; I've swallowed your capers, I've swallowed your sauce,<br>
&nbsp; And it's plain to be seen that my only course<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is swallowing you."&nbsp; He did.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; THE MORAL: The wisest lambs they are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, when they're assailed by thirst,<br>
&nbsp; Keep well away from a public bar;<br>
&nbsp; For of all black sheep, or near, or far,<br>

&nbsp; A raven sat upon a tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not a word he spoke, for<br>
&nbsp; His beak contained a piece of Brie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, maybe, it was Roquefort:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll make it any kind you please--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At all events, it was a cheese.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Beneath the tree's umbrageous limb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hungry fox sat smiling;<br>
&nbsp; He saw the raven watching him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And spoke in words beguiling.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<span style="font-style: italic;">J'admire</span>,"
said he, "<span style="font-style: italic;">ton beau plumage</span>."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The which was simply persiflage.)<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Two things there are, no doubt you know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To which a fox is used:<br>
&nbsp; A rooster that is bound to crow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A crow that's bound to roost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whichsoever he espies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tells the most unblushing lies.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "Sweet fowl," he said, "I understand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're more than merely natty,<br>
&nbsp; I hear you sing to beat the band<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Adelina Patti.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray render with your liquid tongue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bit from 'Gotterdammerung.'"<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; This subtle speech was aimed to please<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crow, and it succeeded:<br>
&nbsp; He thought no bird in all the trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could sing as well as he did.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In flattery completely doused,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave the "Jewel Song" from "Faust."<br>
      <br>
[Illustration: "'<span style="font-style: italic;">J'ADMIRE</span>,'
SAID HE, '<span style="font-style: italic;">TON BEAU PLUMAGE</span>'"]<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; But gravitation's law, of course,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Isaac Newton showed it,<br>
&nbsp; Exerted on the cheese its force,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And elsewhere soon bestowed it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, there is no need to tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened when to earth it fell.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; I blush to add that when the bird<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Took in the situation<br>
&nbsp; He said one brief, emphatic word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfit for publication.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fox was greatly startled, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He only sighed and answered "Tut."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; THE MORAL is: A fox is bound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be a shameless sinner.<br>
&nbsp; And also: When the cheese comes round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know it's after dinner.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But (what is only known to few)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fox is after dinner, too.<br>

&nbsp; A fisher was casting his flies in a brook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to laws of such sciences,<br>
&nbsp; With a patented reel and a patented hook<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a number of other appliances;<br>
&nbsp; And the thirty-fifth cast, which he vowed was the last<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (It was figured as close as a decimal),<br>
&nbsp; Brought suddenly out of the water a trout<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of measurements infinitesimal.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; This fish had a way that would win him a place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the best and most polished society,<br>
&nbsp; And he looked at the fisherman full in the face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a visible air of anxiety:<br>
&nbsp; He murmered "Alas!" from his place in the grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, when he'd twisted and wriggled, he<br>
&nbsp; Remarked in a pet that his heart was upset<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And digestion all higgledy-piggledy.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "I request," he observed, "to be instantly flung<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again in the pool I've been living in."<br>
&nbsp; The fisherman said, "You will tire out your tongue.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you see any signs of my giving in?<br>
&nbsp; Put you back in the pool? Why, you fatuous fool,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have eaten much smaller and thinner fish.<br>
&nbsp; You're not salmon or sole, but I think, on the whole,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're a fairly respectable dinner-fish."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; The fisherman's cook tried her hand on the trout<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with various herbs she embellished him;<br>
&nbsp; He was lovely to see, and there isn't a doubt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the fisherman's family relished him,<br>
&nbsp; And, to prove that they did, both his wife and his kid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Devoured the trout with much eagerness,<br>
&nbsp; Avowing no dish could compare with that fish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding his singular meagreness.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And THE MORAL, you'll find, is although it is kind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To grant favors that people are wishing for,<br>
&nbsp; Still a dinner you'll lack if you chance to throw back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pool little trout that you're fishing for;<br>
&nbsp; If their pleading you spurn you will certainly learn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That herbs will deliciously vary 'em:<br>
&nbsp; It is needless to state that a trout on a plate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beats several in the aquarium. </td>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lit upon his forehead,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gnat lit on her master,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She saw no sense in being lenient<br>

&nbsp; "Oh, lor'!" the startled gnat exclaimed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And promptly had a spasm:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A natural proceeding this was,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering how close the miss was.<br>
      <br>
[Illustration: AND SO A WEIGHTY ROCK SHE AIMED]<br>

&nbsp; Now by his dumb companion's pluck,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (And by the bowlder, also).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, his friends who idolized him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remarked they hardly recognized him.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Of course the bear was greatly grieved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, being just a dumb thing,<br>
&nbsp; She only thought: "I was deceived,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But still, I did hit <span
 style="font-style: italic;">something!</span>"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which showed this masculine achievement<br>

&nbsp; A rooster once pursued a worm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That lingered not to brave him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A pleasant thrill it gave him;<br>

&nbsp; A certain fox had a Grecian nose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a beautiful tail. His friends<br>
&nbsp; Were wont to say in a jesting way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A divinity shaped his ends.<br>
&nbsp; The fact is sad, but his foxship had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fault we should all eschew:<br>
&nbsp; He was so deceived that he quite believed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What he heard from friends was true.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; One day he found in a sheltered spot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trap with stalwart springs<br>
&nbsp; That was cunningly planned to supply the demand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For some of those tippet things.<br>
&nbsp; The fox drew nigh, and resolved to try<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way that the trap was set:<br>
&nbsp; (When the trap was through with this interview<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was one less tippet to get!)<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; The fox returned to his doting friends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And said, with an awkward smile,<br>
&nbsp; "My tail I know was <span style="font-style: italic;">comme il
faut</span>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And served me well for a while."<br>
&nbsp; When his comrades laughed at his shortage aft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He added, with scornful bow,<br>
&nbsp; "Pray check your mirth, for I hear from Worth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They're wearing them shorter now."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; But one of his friends, a bookish chap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replied, with a thoughtful frown,<br>
&nbsp; "You know to-day the publishers say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the short tale won't go down;<br>
&nbsp; And, upon my soul, I think on the whole,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the publishers' words are true.<br>
&nbsp; I should hate, good sir, to part my fur<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle, as done by you."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And another added these truthful words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of the eager hush,<br>
&nbsp; "We can part our hair 'most anywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So long as we keep the brush."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; THE MORAL is this: It is never amiss<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To treasure the things you've penned:<br>
&nbsp; Preserve your tales, for, when all else fails,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They'll be useful things--in the end.<br>

&nbsp; A Caledonian piper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was walking on the wold<br>
&nbsp; Nearly stepped upon a viper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rendered torpid by the cold;<br>
&nbsp; By the sight of her admonished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He forbore to plant his boot,<br>
&nbsp; But he showed he was astonished<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way he muttered "Hoot!"<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; Now this simple-minded piper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a kindly nature had<br>
&nbsp; That he lifted up the viper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bestowed her in his plaid.<br>
&nbsp; "Though the Scot is stern, at least he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No unhappy creature spurns,<br>
&nbsp; 'Sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,'"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quoth the piper (quoting Burns).<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; This was unaffected kindness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was, to state the fact,<br>
&nbsp; Just a slight <span style="font-style: italic;">soup&ccedil;on</span>
of blindness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his charitable act.<br>
&nbsp; If you'd watched the piper, shortly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You'd have seen him leap aloft,<br>
&nbsp; As this snake, of ways uncourtly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bit him suddenly and oft.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; There was really no excuse for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, the viper's cruel work,<br>
&nbsp; And the piper found a use for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words he'd never learned at kirk;<br>
&nbsp; But the biting was so thorough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That although the doctors tried,<br>
&nbsp; Not the best in Edinburgh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could assist him, and he died.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; And THE MORAL is: The piper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the matter made a botch;<br>
&nbsp; One can hardly blame the viper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If she took a nip of Scotch,<br>
&nbsp; For she only did what he did,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And <span style="font-style: italic;">his</span>
nippie wasn't small,<br>
&nbsp; Otherwise, you see, he needed<br>

&nbsp; A Boston man an ulster had,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ulster with a cape that fluttered:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now watch me," cried this spell of
weather,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll rid him of it altogether."<br>

&nbsp; It whirled the man across the street,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It banged him up against a railing,<br>
&nbsp; It twined the ulster round his feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all of this was unavailing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For not without resource it found him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drew the ulster closer round him.<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; "My word!" the man was heard to say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I like not such abuse, it's<br>
&nbsp; Not strange the wind is strong to-day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It always is in Massachusetts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such weather threatens much the health of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inhabitants this Commonwealth of."<br>
      <br>
&nbsp; The sun, emerging from a rift<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the clouds, observed the victim,<br>
&nbsp; And how the wind beset and biffed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Belabored, buffeted, and kicked him.<br>

here:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His every limb seemed slowly melting,<br>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

electronic works

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

1.E.9.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
